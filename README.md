# Hello Chat App

This is a Flutter application that allows users to chat in a big "group" chat room and for each user to provide their name and a fun color to go along with their messages.

The app connects to a Node.JS/Socket.io backend that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/joshuazbeck/hellochat-backend)
